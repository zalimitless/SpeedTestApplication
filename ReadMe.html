  <div class="stackedit__html"><h1 id="the-goal">The Goal</h1>
<p>This software provides the user the ability to track the internet speed and visualize it on a graph using NodeJS and Python.<br>
By building the applications into binaries, it allows you to execute this code on any Windows machine.</p>
<h1 id="speedtest">Speedtest</h1>
<p>The speedtest application is using NodeJS as the engine with a few libraries to assist with tracking the internet speed.</p>
<h3 id="installing-nodejs">Installing NodeJS</h3>
<p>To install NodeJS you can download it from here: <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">nodejs.org/en/download</a></p>
<h3 id="libraries">Libraries</h3>
<p>The primary library that we are using is <strong>fast-speedtest-api</strong> which can be installed after you have completed the NodeJS installation.<br>
Simply run <code>npm i fast-speedtest-api</code> to download the library to your local application.<br>
You can also run <code>npm i --global fast-speedtest-api</code> if you want to install the library for all applications.</p>
<h3 id="logic">Logic</h3>
<p>When the speedtest application is run, it will do one test against <a href="http://Fast.com">Fast.com</a> which is hosted by Netflix.<br>
The download speed results is then written to a json file formatted to match that day’s date.<br>
If you want to setup a system that will periodically run this application, you can either use <a href="https://www.jenkins.io">Jenkins</a> or <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/taskschd/task-scheduler-start-page">Windows Tasks</a>.<br>
Most computers support Windows Tasks, but not all support Jenkins.</p>
<h3 id="building-the-application">Building the Application</h3>
<p>Building the application is rather unreliable, but possible.<br>
The software I use to build is called <code>nexe</code> and is available on <a href="https://github.com/nexe/nexe">github.com/nexe</a><br>
If you have any issues running the Build.bat file, please run it from command prompt then install the required packages it suggests.</p>
<p>The Build.bat file simply runs the following command:<br>
<code>nexe SpeedTest.js --build --verbose</code><br>
Any issues will present itself when run from Command Prompt.</p>
<p>It will then finally compile the code into a <strong>SpeedTest.exe</strong> application.</p>
<h1 id="data-visualizer">Data Visualizer</h1>
<p>To be honest, this is not the best application I have ever written as it is slow and difficult to maintain.<br>
However, it does get the job done with the following available abilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plot the speed graph of the selected file(s)</li>
<li>Calculate the standard deviation (accuracy) of the overall data.</li>
<li>Calculate the average</li>
<li>Align all data onto one graph and timeframe.</li>
<li>Load in multiple json data files, generated by the Speedtest application.</li>
<li>Run the application without selecting a file (Requires the data files to be in the same folder)</li>
</ul>
<p>The application is written in python using <code>matplotlib</code> as it’s plotting application.</p>
<h3 id="installing-python">Installing Python</h3>
<p>You can install the latest Python binaries by visiting <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">python.org/downloads</a><br>
This should also include a <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pip/">Package Installer for Python</a> called <code>pip</code><br>
Once python is installed, you can use <strong>pip</strong> to install <code>matplotlib</code>:</p>
<pre><code>pip install matplotlib
</code></pre>
<h3 id="logic-1">Logic</h3>
<p>This application takes in arguments either from the CLI or by dragging the files over the executable.<br>
If no arguments is provided, it will search for the latest available JSON file in the folder and use that.<br>
The data is loaded from the file and used for calculating variables such as the overall average, standard deviation, S1-S3 (Ranges) and cleaning up data.</p>
<ul>
<li>S1: This bracket tells us that around 68% of all data can be found within this bracket.</li>
<li>S2: About 95% of all data can be found within this bracket.</li>
<li>S3: Around 99.7% of all data can be found within this bracket.</li>
</ul>
<p>At least according to Google…<br>
This means, that the smaller the Standard Deviation is, the more stable the network is. However if the Standard Deviation is large, the network is rather unstable.</p>
<h3 id="building-the-application-1">Building the Application</h3>
<p>The builder is using <code>pyinstaller</code> which should be installed by running <code>pip install pyinstaller</code><br>
The <code>Build.bat</code> file contains the following code:</p>
<pre><code>set hour=%time:~0,2%
if "%hour:~0,1%" == " " set hour=0%hour:~1,1%
set min=%time:~3,2%
if "%min:~0,1%" == " " set min=0%min:~1,1%
set secs=%time:~6,2%
if "%secs:~0,1%" == " " set secs=0%secs:~1,1%
set year=%date:~-2%
set month=%date:~4,2%
if "%month:~0,1%" == " " set month=0%month:~1,1%
set day=%date:~7,2%
if "%day:~0,1%" == " " set day=0%day:~1,1%
set datetimef=%day%%month%%year%_%hour%%min%%secs%
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed "show_graph.py" -n "ShowGraph_%datetimef%"
</code></pre>
<p>A quick breakdown of the code is as follows:<br>
We are splitting the current date and time into different variables to get the format: <code>ShowGraph_ddMMyyyy_hhmmss.exe</code><br>
Then we are using that format to be our output file name.<br>
You can read more on the documentation here at <a href="https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/">pyinstaller’s home page</a><br>
Running this code will finally give you an executable file which you can run on any page.</p>
<h1 id="other-information">Other Information</h1>
<p>When compiling these applications into binaries, the executable is backwards compatible and can be run on older and newer versions of Windows, such as Windows 8, 8.1, 10 and 11.<br>
This project is developed with the intention of helping the user visualize the internet speeds that they are using, as well as assisting consultants with debugging any network issues over a period of time.</p>
